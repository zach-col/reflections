When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate on project's and to backup code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Having Git automatically update your code will not be a feasible sollution. For instance if you are working on fixing a bug and the code keep get's changed it can be very frustrating.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork's are good for changing other people's code and let's you give credit to original creater.Branche's are good for labeling off when you are making a update to certain code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can work on the code without internet.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaborating without git and githob would be time consuming sending the files back and forth having to check them.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You would want to make changes in a seperate branch other then master in the case you want to make some test's, doing this would benefit you by not changing the current project you are working on. The benefit of working on the master branch is being up to date with the current code.
